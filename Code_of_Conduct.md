  - High quality of work is expected from each team member.
  - Hesitance to give feedback and ideas has no place in our team.
  - Work will be distributed equally and divided over the three team
    members.

    is our way to make sure that we collected the best ideas from all
    team members.

  - Meeting are attended in person and if it is not possible then remote
    meetings can be considered.
  - Meetings Agendas and Minutes of meetings are assigned to two of the
    team members every meeting rotating the responsibility.

    reviewed by both team members and will be merged once all
    suggestions are considered.

    team member to submit their work on the master repository without
    being reviewed by the rest of the team members. Â© 2019 GitHub, Inc.
