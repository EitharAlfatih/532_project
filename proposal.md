## Motivation and Purpose

## Dataset

We will be visualizing a dataset containing 7500 observations. This
dataset contains 5 variables. The column (`job`) specifies the jobs
represented in the dataset, which are 250 jobs. Two genders have been
considered; men and women and listed in the column (`sex`). The data was
collected in 2001, for the years from 1850 till 2000 represented in a
10-year time step in a column (`year`). The reported number of
employments for each gender is represented in the (`count`) column. A
percentage of the count of employment of a job over the total count of
employment of all the jobs for a specific decade is showed in a column
(`perc`).
